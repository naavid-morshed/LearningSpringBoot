CLI commands:
    1. create database morshed;
    2. USE morshed; [without this, mysql cannot create table inside that database]
                    [however, during table creation, CREATE TABLE morshed.student_table
                     will automatically connect the table to morshed database]
    3. CREATE TABLE student_table (
           student_id Int PRIMARY KEY,
           name VARCHAR(20),
           major VARCHAR(20)
           # PRIMARY KEY(student_id) [this also works]
       );
    4. DESCRIBE student_table; [will describe the table and all its infos]
    5. DROP TABLE student_table; [will delete the table]
    6. ALTER TABLE student_table ADD gpa DECIMAL(3,2); [will add a new column to table]
    7. ALTER TABLE student_table DROP COLUMN gpa; [if that db is not in use mode then use db_name.student_table]
    8. INSERT INTO student_table VALUES (1,'Naavid Morshed','CSE');
