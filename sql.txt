Data types of SQL:
    1. INT
    2. Decimal(10,4) [10 total digits, 4 of those digits are after decimal point]
    3. Varchar(length) [length is of type Integer]
    4. BLOB [Binary Large Object, stores lots of binary data]
    5. Date
    6. Timestamp

CLI commands: [sql works in both upper and lower cases,
               upper case is convention so the queries are easier to read]
    1. create database morshed;
    2. USE morshed; [without this, mysql cannot create table inside that database]
                    [however, during table creation, CREATE TABLE morshed.student_table
                     will automatically connect the table to morshed database]
    3. CREATE TABLE student_table (
           student_id Int PRIMARY KEY,
           name VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
           major VARCHAR(20)
           # PRIMARY KEY(student_id) [this also works]
       );
    4. DESCRIBE student_table; [will describe the table and all its infos]
    5. DROP TABLE student_table; [will delete the table]
    6. ALTER TABLE student_table ADD gpa DECIMAL(3,2); [will add a new column to table]
    7. ALTER TABLE student_table DROP COLUMN gpa; [if that db is not in use mode then use db_name.student_table]
    8. INSERT INTO student_table VALUES (1,'Naavid Morshed','CSE');
    9. INSERT INTO student_table(student_id, name) VALUES (2,'Saleh Ahmed');
      [for specifying which infos will be posted in the table,
       in this example I chose to forgo the field major]
   10. UNIQUE [use after declaration to specify that particular field cannot have duplicate values]
   11.
